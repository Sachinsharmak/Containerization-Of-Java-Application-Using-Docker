![Containerization of Java Project using Docker](https://github.com/Sachinsharmak/Containerization-Of-Java-Application-Using-Docker/assets/90332526/4907b52b-044f-4f47-bd96-0f6b9cac308d)

1. This project focuses on containerization, exploring how to containerize an existing application efficiently. We'll discuss the need for container technologies and real-world use cases.

2. Traditional deployment models often lead to resource inefficiencies and operational complexities,
especially in managing multi-tier application stacks. Containers offer a transformative solution by
reducing resource consumption and streamlining deployment processes, ideal for agile and microservices architectures.

3. Statistics highlight the widespread adoption of containers across industries, emphasizing their role in production environments and DevOps practices.
4. Our project aims to containerize the V-profile application stack using Docker. We'll create Dockerfiles
to customize services like Engine X, Tomcat, and MySQL, orchestrate containers with Docker Compose, and push customized images to Docker Hub.

5. we are going to use a Docker as our container runtime environment to build images and we're going to contemporize our V profile application stack.
